    <p>1. If any legal trouble that is encountered, it is not our obligation to help. Our only job is to assist in making projects, and any legal trouble is none of our business. </p>
    
    <p>2. We reserve the right to deny and reject requests. Any unreasonable, terrible, or joke requests will be rejected. Submitting too many "joke" requests will result in your requests being ignored.</p>

    <p>3. You will be required an email address and a Discord account to properly utilise our service. This will be kept private and will only be used to communicate and exchange information for the requested project. None of your personal information will be publicised but will be kept for communication purpose only.</p>

    
    <p>Very simple, just don't be stupid.</p>
