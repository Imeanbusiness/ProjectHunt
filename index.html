      <h1>Why Project Hunt?</h1>
      
    </center>
    <p>Project Hunt was created to assist people with minor things, and to help inform and spread information. It was also created for fun, as doing these projects also help me learn as well. If you do choose to use Project Hunt's services, thank you very much, and the work will be done as well as possible.</p>
